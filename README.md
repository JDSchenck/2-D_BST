# 2-D_BST
[Java] This algorithm implements advanced recursion techniques to traverse and manipulate a 2-D Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure.

Test2DBST.java : Driver, test class for level-order tree traversal output from recursive algorithm
TwoDTree.java : Contains the recursive algorithm responsible for proper tree traversal and branching based on the 2D tree specifications

README.md : Just this basic description :)
